# Plugin Template
This plugin template is a template for a plugin. It doesn't really do anything yet, but if it did I would describe what it does here.
## Configuration
These are the options and what they do, etc, etc.
* option 1
* option 2
* option 3
## Shortcodes
* ### [shortcode_name id="5" name="Fred"]
  ** id: the id
  ** name: the name
  This shortcode creates a paragraph with a name and ID, for some reason.
## Other functions
